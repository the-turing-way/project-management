# Draft of Governance Structure

This document is developed by Malvika Sharan (2020-2021) and agreed with Kirstie Whitaker as an initial recommendation to developing _The Turing Way_ governance.
We aim to recruit a team of up to 10 members who will collaboratively work in _The Turing Way_ Governance Taskforce to collaboratively develop documents required to have an equitably designed governance structure.
The Governance Taskforce will be established to make sure that diverse perspectives, experiences and concerns are represented.
Each member will be provided with any accessibility support that might be required to sustain their participation.
They will be offered a stipend/honoraria to recognise their crucial work in the project and recompense for their time.
The governance documents will sit in the community handbook, foreword and afterword of the book.
All discussions and drafts will be transparently shared via _The Turing Way_ GitHub repository.
A detailed document will be created to communicate roles, responsibilities and expectations for the Governance Taskforce members.

## Vision, Mission and Values

- Vision: Embed reproducibility, ethics and collaboration into research and data science practices.

- Mission:
    - Build and maintain an open source community-driven guide to data science.
    - Share reproducible tools, recommendations and examples from across academia, industry and public sectors.
    - Establish communication and collaboration as integral aspects of inclusive research.
    - Inspire project design principles that empower all stakeholders to collaborate equitably.
    - Provide guidance for ethical research in data science that respect, protect, and fulfil human rights.
    - Involve diverse perspectives in developing research practices that make data science accessible and beneficial for everyone (as wide an audience as possible).

- Community values: 
  - keywords and short sentences 
  - Potentially aligned with values from ATI and TPS rules of the game
  - Maybe revisited every year
  - (selected by the governance taskforce members)

## Goals and objectives

- Provide all the information that data scientists in academia, industry, government and the third sector need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce and reuse at the end.
- Investing in the development of socio-technical skills in researchers required to work in a team and distributed communities.
- Foster a *community of practice* by involving and supporting diverse contributors with different backgrounds, identities and domain expertise.
- (extended by the governance taskforce members)

**What will the world look like if your community has achieved its mission?**

- The moonshot goal of the project is to make reproducible research "too easy not to do".

**Background**
Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that all results can be independently verified, trusted and built upon in future work.
This is sometimes easier said than done.
Sharing these research outputs means understanding and implementing techniques for research reproducibility throughout the life cycle of a research: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists.
We recognise that the burden of requirement and new skill acquisition can be intimidating to individuals who are new to this world.
to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do" even for people who have never worked in this way before.
It will include training material on version control, analysis testing, and open and transparent communication with future users, and build on Turing Institute case studies and workshops.
This project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).

## Community resources
(Community Resources are assets in a community that help meet certain needs for those around them. These assets can be people, places or structures, and community services. These resources can be essential in developing skills post-discharge by helping the client diversify their range of outlets of support, expression and natural self-development.
This will be a list of resources that are described in community handbook)

## Governance Structure
*The subcomponents under structure are organizational design and reporting structure and the structure of the committees and charters.*

- Three parts of open governance
    - **Core team:**
        - project lead
        - Staff members
    - **Advisory group/board**
        - Strategic visioning and scoping
        - Nomination based
    - **Steering committee**
        - Members leading on specific priority areas recognised and recommended by advisory group
        - Identifying standard workflow and recongnising interoperability
            - Startegy document: See [OHT strategy 2021-2022 for example](https://www.onehealthtech.com/our-strategy-2021-2022)
        - RFC for community-feedback
            - step 1: Targeted email to specific people (Turing, partner projects) + Open for TPS leadership
            - step 2: Community
- **Model for steering committee**
    - Elected and selected model
    - Selected by board to develop sustainability plans
    - Elected by community to develop community involvement
    - Giving people opportunities for leadership by each leading a working group

- **Working groups**
    - Each led by one steering committee member
    - Open calls for expression of interest from community to join
    - What resources are available for them? How can they access it?

- **Community roles**
    - Emergent leadership pathways
    - Community-led initiatives
    - What are the process that they can ask for support, approval and potentially a seat in the steering committee

<!--Community handbook-->
## Oversight Responsibilities
*Key subcomponents under this component are board oversight and responsibilities, management accountability and authority, and the authority and responsibilities of the committees.*

- Defining high level responsibilities and decision-making
    - Core team-leadership: does all the "red button"/off-limit decision that can not be taken independent of the core team
        - TPS leadership members/reporting, Turing Training, Turing Funding
        - Streamlining work from advisory board -> steerting committee
    - Core team-staff:
        - Operational and time intensive jobs
        - Ensuring integration of all feedback
        - Maintain transparency and reporting
        - Keep track of contributions, history and updates
    - Advisory board
        - Nomination based from both leadership and committee
- Steering committee will look into specific priority area:
    - EDIA
    - Infrastructure and development
    - mentorship and expert support
    - impact and research
    - gap analysis
    - sustainability strategy
    - Book Dash

## Ways of working/operating agreement
- How do different roles fit in the project, what pathways exist, what resources are available commonly for them and specifically for each of them
    - Define workflow for the different groups working on priority areas
- Standardising community workflow
    - Work responsibilities
    - Describing seats
