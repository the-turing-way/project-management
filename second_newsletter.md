# The Turing Way - February update

Dear friends of the Turing Way,

It's been almost a month since we announced the project and we've made great progress since then that we think you should know about.

## Workshops
We still have spots available for our workshops in March. 
We can provide financial support to cover travel, accommodation or childcare costs to make it easier for you to attend. 
Please get in touch to let us know how we can support you.

### Boost your reproducibility with binder

During this free workshop we will discuss reproducible computing environments, show examples of othersâ€™ projects in myBinder.org and help you learn how to prepare a binder-ready project. 
At the end of the workshop you will be able to take some of your own content (in a R or Jupyter notebook, or scripts that can be run in the terminal) and prepare it so that it can be used by others on myBinder.org.

**Agenda**

9.30 - 10.00: Coffee and Registration

10.00 - 10.30: Introduction to the workshop and The Turing Way

10.30 - 12.00: Reproducible computing environment and how Binder can help

12.00 - 1.00: Lunch

1.00 - 2.00: Zero to Binder

2.00 - 3.30: Coffee and Build your own Binder

3.30 - 4.00: Demonstrating your Binder, general questions, feedback and close

4.00 - 5.00: Optional hangout with instructors

### Build a BinderHub workshop

During this free workshop we will demonstrate how to build your own BinderHub on Microsoft Azure cloud computing resources. 
We will help you get started with building a BinderHub on your institution's computing platform and discuss the challenges of maintaining a BinderHub. 
At the end of the workshop you will know why this would be a useful resource for your team, and will know where to look for help and support building your institution's BinderHub.

## Handbook

Three chapters are written and ready for your comments! 
Version control, reproducibility and Open Research are ready for feedback. 
If you want to comment, our updated contributing guidelines are available here.
We're currently working on the chapters on research data management, reproducible computing environments, testing and continuous integration.
You can follow the progress through the [pull requests on our GitHub repsoitory](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls).

## Talks
The team has been spreading the word about the Turing Way project through various talks:
* Kirstie Whitaker presented at the Cambridge Psychiatry PI Day on 30 January 2019. 
Her	slides can be found on [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7649156.v2).
* Sarah Gibson presented at the [UKRI Cloud workshop](https://cloud.ac.uk/workshops/feb2019/). 
Resources for her talk can be found [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/conferences/presentations/UKRI_cloud_2019-02-12/UKRI_cloud_demo_2019-02-12.md).
* Patricia Herterich introduced the Turing Way to the Birmingham Hacker Within community on 18 February 2019. 
Slides for her talk are published on [zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2566430).


We would still love you to share your tips, tricks and gotchas with the Turing Way community!
