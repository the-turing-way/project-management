    * Governance update: 
        * The project is currently following the three-level governance model: constitutional level - involving leadership-level decision-making that affects the project and community functioning; maintenance level - involving working group level decision-making and organised projects; and community level - engagement of broader stakeholders of the project in informing these decisions: [https://hackmd.io/p_VjibHcT2uvDK2FC7Dx8A?both](https://hackmd.io/p_VjibHcT2uvDK2FC7Dx8A?both). Alexandra drafted this document describing the model and prepared the Miro board to facilitate discussion on this with the core contributors in 2023, inviting their feedback: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnA6G50=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnA6G50=/).  
        * The project delivery team continues to build an understanding and process for transparent decision-making through GitHub infrastructure, community events and documentation. A regular project delivery meeting took place last year, which in 2024 moved to project management meetings taking place biweekly between the project leadership and project management. Meeting notes are shared on GitHub: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/governance](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/governance).
        * Anne has drafted guidelines for working groups which have been reviewed by Malvika and other members of the project delivery team: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3499](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3499). KW has discussed her review comments with the delivery team members and shared progress during the coworking calls. A draft will be finalised during November’s Book Dash.
        * Anne and Arielle are drafting a Data Protection Plan for The Turing Way to manage users' data, such as in managing The Turing Way newsletters, which have recently been transferred from Tinyletter (which no longer operates) to Buttondown. Details: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Project level issue: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3534](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3534)</span>*, and*<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> RCM/RPM issue regarding Data Protection plan: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/2024-rcm-rpm-tasks/issues/34](https://github.com/the-turing-way/2024-rcm-rpm-tasks/issues/34)</span>.
* *Highlights from working groups*
    * The Turing Way Community Forums regularly (2-3 months) featured updates from the Working Groups, notes for which are archived on [GitHub](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/governance/community-calls) ([April](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/governance/community-calls/20240423-community-forum.md), [July](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/governance/community-calls/20240712-community-forum.md)).
    * Working groups for Infrastructure and Accessibility, which were previously provided operational support by Anne (RCM) and Alexandra (RPM) are increasingly self-organised, without necessarily needing support from the delivery team. Working group notes and planning on being hosted in Github repositories.
        * The infrastructure working group: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/infrastructure-working-group](https://github.com/the-turing-way/infrastructure-working-group) 
        * The book dash working group has a (generated from the Working Group template): [https://github.com/the-turing-way/bookdash](https://github.com/the-turing-way/bookdash) 
        * The accessibility working group: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/accessibility-working-group](https://github.com/the-turing-way/accessibility-working-group) 
    * The infrastructure working group has been leading on maintaining and managing the GitHub organisation. Among other maintenance support, they are testing different hosting infrastructures to replace Netlify to transition The Turing Way book to an open source option, and supporting the GitHub organisation structure. They have started with transitioning the domain to the-turing.way.org and the underlying infrastructure to Read the Docs from Netlify.
        * The Infrastructure Working Group has pioneered a new GitHub-centered voting system for voting on domain names (which was also used to rename the Community Call to Community Forum): [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3266#issuecomment-1934599627](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3266#issuecomment-1934599627) 
        * The transition to RtD from Netlify used the platform/infrastructure auditing system that was previously used for communication platforms alone (i.e. Buttondown from Tinyletter): [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509) 
    * The Accessibility working group has drafted a chapter in the Community Handbook to embed accessibility considerations in The Turing Way. They are also working with RCM for AIM-RSF, Sophia Batchelor, on reviewing the chapter on inclusive events and the context of Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement.
        * A new access guide has been added to the community handbook by the Accessibility Working Group: [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/accessibility](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/accessibility)
        * The inclusive events chapter has been split into a PPIE-related chapter and an Accessible Events Chapter. The former is being reviewed by the AIM-RSF community and Accessibility Working Group, and will be merged at Collaborations Workshop 2024: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3550](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3550) 
        * A new accessibility policy has been drafted, and is ready for review: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3581](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3581)
    * The Book Dash working group has been formed to provide a year-long community-led effort co-led by Arielle, along with TPS SRCM Emma Karoune and community member Esther Plomp. With the support from Anne and Alexandra, they onboarded a planning committee and delivered the 10th Book Dash in November. They are preparing to deliver the 11th Book Dash in June with an open call for participants.
        * The Turing Skills team will be collaborating with The Turing Way team to engage the previous learners of the Data Science and AI Educators programme in drafting and sharing pedagogical resources in The Turing Way guides. 
        * Book Dash Working Group meeting notes are archived on GitHub: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/workshops/book-dash/meeting-notes](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/workshops/book-dash/meeting-notes). 
    * Translation and Localisation Working Group: [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/translation](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/translation/translation-workflow.html).  
        * A new governance draft for the localisation team outlining norms, behaviours, and how decisions are made in the localisation is created, focusing on what recognition looks like & how members can progress within their roles & co-lead the team. It also outlines a new meeting structure. It is still a work in progress (to be shared later). The initial draft was shared and discussed in the localisation co-working call. The localisation team is looking into adding additional points around how the localisation team can allow 2 directional flows for the localisation and at the same time maintain the integrity of the original content while being culturally and contextually relevant.
        * They held a lessons-learned call with the Ukrainian Carpentries translation project, going over pain points within their localisation workflow.
        * The co-leads met again in another session with Rob (Director of Technology, Carpentries) to help the Carpentries set up and help in migrating to Crowdin: [https://turingway.crowdin.com/turing-way](https://turingway.crowdin.com/turing-way). 
        * The localisation team onboarded a new language, Bengali, as requested by a member of the community, which brings the total to 9 languages. Translation takes place in Crowdin:
        * A new delivery plan focusing on documentation, Community Engagement, and Governance Strategy is in progress. The initial draft was discussed with members from Carpentries and The Turing Way.
* *The Turing Way Practitioners Hub* 
    * The Turing Way Practitioners Hub's first cohort was concluded in December 2023. The cohort supported participation from five Experts in Residence (EiRs), who contributed through their participation in workshops on topics including Stakeholder Mapping and Engagement, User Journey Mapping, Open Leadership Practices, Pedagogy of technical teaching, Skills and Knowledge Gap Analysis, Product Strategy and Road Mapping, and Systems Thinking workshop, led by internal Turing researchers, external service providers and BridgeAI partners. A Fireside Chat was hosted with EiRs launching[ 5 case studies](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way-practitioners). This discussion has contributed to a Meta Case Study. The recording for the Case Study launch in December 2023 is uploaded on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdmkaRmY6jI&list=PLBxcQEfGu3Dl521skBqViIQVsSUZ-VYi2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdmkaRmY6jI&list=PLBxcQEfGu3Dl521skBqViIQVsSUZ-VYi2). 
    * A 2024 strategic delivery plan was organised at the beginning of the year with project leads to identify key project dates including the second cohort of Experts in residence start and launch of Expression of interest. A 2024 roadmap was presented to IUK who supported the project delivery plan. The Turing Way Practitioners Hub's work has received positive responses from the BridgeAI leads and they are connecting different opportunities from their network.
    * The Turing Way Practitioners Hub Showcase was hosted on the 6 March, which featured two panel discussions and showcases of the previously published case studies with EiRs, Arielle Bennett and Vicky Hellon (liaisons). 118 people registered to attend the event, with 35 in-person participants and 40 online attendees. The event was delivered successfully. The team received positive feedback as well as connections for future collaboration.
    * A Meta case study was drafted by Malvika and Stuart Gilespie (tech writer) who conducted interviews with BridgeAI partners. The draft features contributions from the Turing, Digital Catapult and BridgeAI partners. The Meta Case study draws common insights from previous case studies, which included multiple authors including the EiRs.[ https://zenodo.org/records/10777730](https://zenodo.org/records/10777730)
    * Recruitment for SRCM for BridgeAI has taken place, with the job accepted by Alexandra who will transition into the project from her current role as an RPM for The Turing Way.
    * An Expression of Interest (EOI) has been launched to join the 2nd Cohort of Experts of residence. 10 interests have been received so far, largely from creative industries. The team took part in AI-UK, where a Turing Way exhibition booth was hosted, which held discussions about The Practitioners Hub programme with the potential partners. 
    * Interactions at the showcase event and AI UK motivated the development and launch of the EoI for individuals to join our network of advisors who can engage with our project and cohort activities. Advisors will bring real-world expertise that can benefit SMEs interested in implementing best practices in data science and AI initiatives in their organisations.
    * After Alexandra Araujo Alvarez (AAA) transitioned to the BridgeAI programme as an SRCM, recruitment for the RPM took place with the role offered to Léllé Demertzi, who joined the team in October.
        * Ella McAffery, as part of her participation in the fast-stream programme, joined the BridgeAI team as a project manager and provided project management support under the mentorship of MS and AAA, specifically supporting the applications, planning and launch of the second cohort.
    * The call for Expression of Interest to join the Second Cohort attracted 42 applications from different companies both in the UK and internationally. 
        * A selection rubric was developed under the supervision of MS, which was used by Ella and Arielle to screen applicants.
        * 21 companies were invited to join the second cohort, who attended an online onboarding webinar. The Turing Way Practitioners Hub - Cohort 2 Introduction Webinar slides with details are available online on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/12740663](https://zenodo.org/records/12740663). 
        * 21 separate onboarding meetings were held in July and August where MS and AB shared the plans for participation and what a memorandum of understanding will contain, as well as shared the next steps.
        * A representative from BBC requested to withdraw their application due to personal capacity but requested to be invited back in 2025.
    * A virtual kick-off call was hosted introducing 20 companies and 40 Experts in Residence (EiR) ([https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub/eirs](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub/eirs)). The presentation included the cohort plans including curriculum, engagement activities and communication.
    * The second cohort plan includes the delivery of a curriculum with four focuses: 
        * Stakeholder Management workshops delivered by Malvika Sharan Part 1 on design thinking: 12 September 2024 (online) and Part 2 on Systems Thinking: on 24 September. For the second part, Mike Nolan was invited to co-facilitate the workshop in person and share the open-source aspects of this work. These workshops aimed to support the development of the stakeholder engagement strategy of the participating companies. Feedback is currently being gathered.
        * AI-readiness Assessment workshops include an introduction to the AI adoption toolkit by Digital Catapult on 10 October and a 2-part Responsible Business Decision Making workshop by the Skills Team - on 17 & 24 October.
        * The open source, ethics and innovation in AI is a 2-day in-person event on 25-26 November, which will feature keynotes, panels and discussions from various industry experts including workstreams and partners of BridgeAI. The first day focusing on open source is being planned with members from Open Forum Europe, UCL, OSPO++, Linux Foundation and the Turing Skills team. Aida Mehonic will also support 1-2 sessions in different capacities. The second day on ethics is being organised with the AI Governance team, Trustworthy Ethical Assurance team and BridgeAI partners, later being coordinated by AAA.
        * A final part of the curriculum in January will focus on the long-term strategy development for real-world adoption, content for which is being planned with Aida Mehonic focusing on her expertise in product management and pull-through.
    * An in-person public launch was hosted at the Turing with information updated on the website: [https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub). Part of this event discussed the opportunities and resources available for case study development, with positive interest from many EiRs.
    * MS and AB are also planning informal sessions in November and December with opportunities for sector-specific interactions and expert sessions on tackling technical challenges, where the BridgeAI ISAs have been invited to meet with the Experts in Residence and provide problem-specific consultation.
    * A timeline was developed by MS to share with the cohort and the Turing’s BridgeAI project management team. This timeline is proposed to be replicated in the next funded year (2025-2026). MS also contributed to the development of an impact assessment framework sharing areas of work from the Practitioners Hub where different aspects of work can be measured to understand and communicate the progress and impact.
* *Professionalising Data Science Roles - Skills Policy Award*
    * On 2 October, Emma hosted a stakeholder workshop at The Turing co-organised with Malvika and Alexandra Araujo Alvarez ([workshop agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bSkbZbAOuNQaLWsXmoMwrHTCDfilJFm7BzuWx6jU5Gk/edit)). Over 40 experts from across different sectors gave input on the current status and future needs for data science roles in their organisations. Malvika and Emma created[ a handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XonpkK9Tn5dixA1_NgE2xN6hItTmFeJzaLZxnkBOmdk/edit) and shared the[ RCM skills framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8337627) to facilitate breakout discussions. RCM team members, Cass, Gabin, Eirini and Vicky, as well as members from different Turing teams including Martin O’Reilly, Annie Mallon, Alden Conner, Vera Matser and Matt Forshaw, facilitated the group discussions. A report from this workshop will be shared and included in a policy briefing building on the examples from the Turing including the REG, RCM and RAM teams. Emma has submitted a detailed report from this project separately.
    * Emma and Malvika worked on the persona draft and Research Community Management manuscript with the RCM skills framework sharing examples of how we can map different skill areas for emerging data science roles that engaged different stakeholders from the Turing. As part of the project report, Emma Karoune and TPS team members recorded a CodeforThought podcast: [https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/14761258-en-building-data-science-teams-alan-turing-institute-skills-and-policy-award-part-i](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/14761258-en-building-data-science-teams-alan-turing-institute-skills-and-policy-award-part-i) 
    * Emma has also drafted the policy review and outcomes from the stakeholders workshops, which will shared openly in April. Coordinated by the Skills team, project mentor, Rachel Hilliam, has provided important resources and connections from her work in the Alliance for Data Science, standards for which are being used as a primary reference. Emma concluded the project in March with the final reports due in April. The project development can be tracked on GitHub:[ https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/professionalising-data-science-roles](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/professionalising-data-science-roles).

**Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress**



* The workload on the team remains high with the growing projects and work within the community, limiting the team from taking advantage of some opportunities that emerge in the project.
* There are many exciting areas of work that we are unable to pursue due to current team capacity. Therefore, the team is focusing their time on strengthening governance in a way that in the future it can be possible for other organisations to support different projects within The Turing Way.

### External engagement, influence, impact (Academic/ industry/ government/ public/ international)

* Malvika concluded her term as an advisor for NASA TOPS with a final panel taking place in Washington DC. This meeting was marked with a launch of the NASA-TOPS101 curriculum that heavily features TTW resources. The meeting also included a visit to the EEOB White House, with a meeting with the Year of Open Science Working group representatives.
* Malvika attended the Software Heritage Symposium at UNESCO and the EU policy forum in Brussels in February, attended by open source representatives from government, policymakers, companies, non-profits and other organisations involved in open source. It was a good opportunity to represent the TPS/Turing and gain insights into the industry's trends.
* The Turing Way Book Dash has been working with researchers supported by the Sloan Foundation in their study of “Hackathon” events.
* As part of their participation in the [CZI’s annual Open Science workshop](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/open-science/) in Boston, MS and KW represented The Turing Way. The event was attended several workshops engaging with the participants from various organisations and community initiatives, including 2i2c, IOI, CS&S, OLS, R-OpenSci, MetaDocencia, CSCCE, Kavli, Navigation Fund, Sloan, Michael J. Fox Foundation, NASA, CERN and more.
* MS and AB attended the OSPOs for Good in New York in July ([https://www.un.org/techenvoy/content/ospos-good-2024](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/content/ospos-good-2024)). Hosted by the UN, OSPO++ and Open Forum Europe, the event focused on how OSPOs are providing new forms of global cooperation around open source for good in countries. 
    * During the side event by Microsoft “What’s next for OSS”, MS provided organisational support representing The Turing Way and chaired a panel during the “OSPOs for Good: Dialog on Impact” session to highlight perspectives from open source ([https://events.linuxfoundation.org/whatsnext4oss/program/schedule/](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/whatsnext4oss/program/schedule/)). 
    * She was also a mentor on community management at the speed mentoring session, presenting examples from the RCM team and The Turing Way.
    * This event has led to collaboration in the context of The Practitioners Hub, specifically for the in-person event in November.
* In September, MS attended the [Open Science Dynamic Convergence Workshop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/135_UIM9HAC3ZgJkMC05dJXHPPoA0NYYh/view) organised by the Open Research Community Accelerator, with support from UNESCO, NASA and the Sloan Foundation. She facilitated two-part discussion sessions during the event on the theme “Acceleration”. The other two parallel discussions focused on “Engagement” and “Coordination”. Volunteer community member, Esther Plomp attended the workshop as a facilitator for the session “Coordination”. She also spoke at a panel on Dynamic Convergence.
* MS is supporting Data Science Without Borders, previously through a formal collaboration with the Turing and now in a personal capacity, supporting their work in open science by facilitating their engagement with The Turing Way. 
* The Turing Way Book Dash has been working with researchers supported by the Sloan Foundation in their study of “Hackathon” events. Initially planned for June’s Book Dash, due to lack of ethics approval, the interviews with the Book Dash attendees are now being planned for the November sessions.
* MS was invited to join the assessment committee for the Call for proposals “Strengthening Local and Thematic Digital Competence” by the FAIR Research Data at Open Science NL, which is part of the Dutch Research Council NWO. She, alongside other panellists, reviewed applications on the resource allocation and establishment of data stewards and community managers in the applicants’ organisations in the Netherlands.
* MS contributed to the Sloan Foundation-funded project by the Research Software Alliance to scope an international workshop for the research software community. Drawing examples from her work in open science and The Turing Way engagements, she Invited the group to collaborate with The Turing Way Practitioners Hub and Book Dash.

### Funding: Further funding, leveraged funding/support, in-kind contributions

* Translation and Localisation Working Group collaborated with project leads to develop a proposal for Ford's DIIF grant, with Kirstie as PI, which although did not get funded, was shared by Malvika with the CZI team following a workshop at an event hosted on localisation in Latin America. A potential discussion for funding will be taking place to explore new funding opportunities to support community work.
* A Translation and Localisation proposal was resubmitted by Batool Almarzouq with support from MS to the Digital Infrastructure Insight Fund during the second call to conduct systematic research to understand the open source infrastructure needs and solutions. The proposal was not funded.

### Awards/recognition

* Alejandro Coca Castro, a TPS member and core contributor of The Turing Way is one of three winners of the 2024 Dorothy Bishop Prize | UK Reproducibility Network. [https://www.ukrn.org/2024/03/28/winners-of-the-2024-dorothy-bishop-prize/](https://www.ukrn.org/2024/03/28/winners-of-the-2024-dorothy-bishop-prize/). He was commended for his work in the Environmental Data Science book, a project that draws inspiration from The Turing Way and continues to have close ties to the project.
* The Turing Way proposal for the Research Culture Award was resubmitted by the team in February: [https://zenodo.org/records/10935593](https://zenodo.org/records/10935593). The winner will be announced in September.
* Malvika applied to add The Turing Way to the Digital Public Good Alliance. The Turing Way has been approved to be listed for SDG 4 (lifelong learning and quality education): [https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/). The United Nations Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation defines DPGs as open source solutions such as software, data and content that contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). *The Turing Way* is listed under the 'content' type and for contributing to SDG Number 4: "Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning".
* Facilitated by ALS, The Turing Way members submitted four proposals for the Hidden REF Award, to highlight the work of working groups in the community dedicated to Book Dash, Infrastructure, Accessibility, and Translation. 
* The Turing Way proposal for the Research Culture Award was resubmitted by MS, AB and KW in February, which was not successful.
