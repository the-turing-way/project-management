## Overview of the project

**Overview of the project:** _The Turing Way_ is an open source and community-led project that aims to make data science comprehensible and useful for everyone. This project brings together its diverse community of researchers, educators, learners, administrators and stakeholders from within The Alan Turing Institute and beyond. _The Turing Way_ provides a web-based book with five guides on reproducible research, project design, communication, collaboration and ethical research, as well as a community handbook.

The project is available online on GitHub ([https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)) under the CC-BY license owned by _The Turing Way_ community. The project uses Jupyter Book ([https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book)) to host its content online at [https://the-turing-way.netlify.com](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/).

## First Quarter: 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022.

### General updates:

#### Project and community statistics: 
* Book: 55 chapters with 250+ live pages
* Contributors on GitHub: 325 contributors (starred by 1300+ users)
* Twitter: 2,789 followers
* Newsletter: 593 subscribers
* Slack workspace: 374 members
* Project team: The Turing Way core team now hosts 18 members including the Turing Community Managers, Research Application Managers, Programme Manager and volunteer contributors. Four members from the community were also formally recognised as the Translation and Localisation Leads, and included in the project team document.

#### Past events and updates
* The new Community Manager of The Turing Way, Anne Lee Steele joined the project in March 2022. 
* Weekly coworking calls (every Monday, 11:00 - 12:00 GMT) and bi-monthly Collaboration Cafes (first and third Wednesday of each month) took place as planned with an exception for the Bank Holidays.
* We hosted two Fireside Chat series in February and March 2022. The February’s Fireside chat was co-organised with the Talarify Founder and Director, Anelda van der Walt, on the topic “Gaps & Opportunities for Inclusive, Multilingual Data Science”. The event speakers included Batool Almarzouq (Saudi Arabia), Bobby Shabangu (South Africa), Camila Rangel-Smith (the Turing, UK), David Pérez-Suárez (UCL, UK) and Yanina Bellini Saibene (Argentina). The March’s event was co-organised with the Open Post Academics (OPA) programme, on the topic “Emergent Roles in Research Infrastructure & Technology". Chaired by Beth Duckles (OPA, USA) and Arielle Bennett (the Turing, UK), this panel will feature insights from Noor Shaker (Glamorous AI, UK), Esther Plomp (TU Delft, Netherlands) and Borhane (Bo) Blili-Hamelin (OPA, USA). Each event had an average of 65 registrations, with community members coming from international universities, organisations and funding groups.
* The Turing-Crick Data Science Training for Biomedical Scientists, funded from October 2021, or March 2022 by the AI for Science and Government was hosted under the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme. The programme funding allowed to buy out 0.5 FTE of one Data Scientist, Lydia France, who was involved in the development of the first drafts of the two training modules in The Carpentries incubator shared under the CC-BY 4.0 License. Led by Malvika Sharan, Lydia France, senior data scientists, Federico Nanni and the Health theme lead, Alisha Davies, designed and carried out feedback interviews with several senior researchers and fellows from the Cricka and Turing institutes. Since the project requires further review and development, a review and illustration sprint has been planned on 28 and 29 April (with a webinar of 11 April), that will be attended by 15 international researchers who would like to use the training materials in their own organisations.
* The next Book Turing Way Dash event is planned to take place from 16 to 20 May 2022. The Book Dash committee will be joined by 8 returning participants and core team members, who will help run the call for application, review and select the participants, and host the different sessions during the event. Two community-share out has been planned on 20 May to allow participants outside the Book Dash to get an overview of the project after the Book Dash.

#### Upcoming projects
* Two new community managers joining the AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Research Support Facility (AIM RSF) will join the team of Community Managers, as well as the project team of The Turing Way. Learning from other community managers will help establish cross-project collaboration while ensuring the adoption of the best practices from The Turing Way at the Turing and beyond. Like all Research Application Managers (RAM), the new RAM for the Data Safe Haven will also be onboarded in The Turing Way project team.
* The Turing Skills team members are collaborating with Malvika Sharan to develop two programmes, AI and Data Science and Educators Programme and TPS Peer Mentoring Programmes. Call for applications for both have been launched.
* We have submitted a project proposal for the Google Season of Code (GSoC) to invite candidates (student developers and coders) to work on The Turing Way for three months. With our project plan, we are interested in improving and integrating a Python package developed for The Turing Way to enhance the usability of our book. Project ideas are shared on the GitHub issue and Neurostars.

Chaired by Beth Duckles (OPA, USA) and Arielle Bennett (the Turing, UK), this panel will feature insights from Noor Shaker (Glamorous AI, UK), Esther Plomp (TU Delft, Netherlands) and Borhane (Bo) Blili-Hamelin (OPA, USA). Each event had an average of 65 registrations, with community members coming from international universities, organisations and funding groups.
  - [The Turing-Crick Data Science Training for Biomedical Scientists](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience), funded from October 2021, or March 2022 by the AI for Science and Government was hosted under the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme. The programme funding allowed to buy out 0.5 FTE of one Data Scientist, Lydia France, who was involved in the development of the first drafts of the two training modules in The Carpentries incubator shared under the CC-BY 4.0 License. Led by Malvika Sharan, Lydia France, senior data scientists, Federico Nanni and the Health theme lead, Alisha Davies, designed and carried out feedback interviews with several senior researchers and fellows from the Cricka and Turing institutes. Since the project requires further review and development, a review and illustration sprint has been planned on 28 and 29 April (with a webinar of 11 April), that will be attended by 15 international researchers who would like to use the training materials in their own organisations.
  - The [next Book Turing Way Dash event](https://forms.gle/uEbu1FJMmdfgGwvW6) is planned to take place from 16 to 20 May 2022. The Book Dash committee will be joined by 8 returning participants and core team members, who will help run the call for application, review and select the participants, and host the different sessions during the event. Two community-share out has been planned on 20 May to allow participants outside the Book Dash to get an overview of the project after the Book Dash.

- _Upcoming projects:_
  - Two new community managers joining the AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Research Support Facility (AIM RSF) will join the team of Community Managers, as well as the project team of The Turing Way. Learning from other community managers will help establish cross-project collaboration while ensuring the adoption of the best practices from The Turing Way at the Turing and beyond. Like all Research Application Managers (RAM), the new RAM for the Data Safe Haven will also be onboarded in The Turing Way project team.
  - The Turing Skills team members are collaborating with Malvika Sharan to develop two programmes, AI and Data Science and Educators Programme and TPS Peer Mentoring Programmes. Call for applications for both have been launched.
  - We have submitted a project proposal for the [Google Season of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) to invite candidates (student developers and coders) to work on _The Turing Way_ for three months. With our project plan, we are interested in improving and integrating a Python package developed for _The Turing Way_ to enhance the usability of our book. Project ideas are shared on the[GitHub issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2266) and[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/t/gsoc-2022-project-idea-3-1-the-turing-way-a-how-to-guide-to-data-science-175-350-h/21380).

**Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress**

- Increased workloads on the project leads due to larger team size.
