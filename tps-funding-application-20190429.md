### Abstract

*Max 500 words*

Funded as part of the first wave of projects within the Tools, Practices and Systems programme, _The Turing Way_ is currently a handbook for reproducible data science (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
This work package will extend _The Turing Way_ into a series of books: "A How To Guide to Data Science", with the current book being one of them.
Our goal is to capture the vast amounts of knowledge of data science practices from within the Turing community and beyond.
Following an open source, community driven approach, we will welcome contributions from anyone who can support researchers and practitioners in learning or improving the "how" of conducting world-leading research in data science and AI.
This funding request will support a research engineer (1 FTE, 18 months) with expertise in documentation, training, and community building to manage the contributions to the book and four "book dash" events to engage and nurture _The Turing Way_ community.

Reproducibility is important, and multifaceted.
The book currently has chapters on open research, research data management, version control, reproducible computational environments, testing, and continuous integration.
But it does not cover core data science practices such as whether the scientific question is appropriately scoped, if the statistical assumptions are correctly managed, whether a suitable algorithm or model was applied, how these results may vary according to different fluctuations across systems, in the choice of random seeds, or in how results are visualised to tell a story.
The book does not currently include the aspects of data science and artificial intelligence that define whether work was ethically designed and reported.
By curating this knowledge in an accessible format, _The Turing Way_ series will support the The Turing Institute's goals of delivering world class research, training the leaders of tomorrow, and leading the public conversation.

_The Turing Way_ will not replace academic journals or software packages.
Rather it is a pedagogical opportunity.
A translation of research outputs into curated tutorials, case studies and checklists.
The books are Jupyter Books (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book) which build and host static web content directly from markdown files or jupyter notebooks in a GitHub repository.
They are easy to version control, edit and extend.
The notebooks are interactive via a Binder plugin.

The _Turing Way_ community is a global collaboration of research engineers, data librarians, industry professionals, and domain expert researchers at all levels of seniority.
Anyone can contribute to the book at any time and our community manager will provide 1:1 mentorship for anyone who wants to incorporate their knowledge into the books.
We will focus on inclusion and creativity at our four "book dash" events.
These one day sprints allow us to bring together a diverse group to co-create the most useful resource for all.
They will contribute their knowledge to the book, review the content for clarity across multiple domains of expertise, and create personalised pathways through the content to add value to as broad a community as possible.

Metrics of success over 18 months:

* 20 new chapters.
* 100 authors (significant contributions to the books).
* 200 contributors (any contribution to the books).
* 1000 mailing list subscribers (currently 200).
* 50 first pull requests.
* 20 new contributors to other open source projects.


### Route to impact

*Max 300 words*

We are committed to giving all early career data scientists the support they need to confidently publish reproducible, accurate, interpretable, and responsible research.
We will support financial analysts, civil servants, people in third sector organisations, and domain experts who need to evaluate applications of data science and AI.
_The Turing Way_ books will be accessible to everyone who wants to learn these skills and the content will adapt to accommodate the needs of these communities.

Pathways:
  * **Training Steering Group** - use of The Turing Way chapters in doctoral training.
  * **Book dash events** - respond to community requests for content and build confidence in early career researchers to share their skills.
  * **Research engineering and partnerships teams** - chapter on effectively scoping an interdisciplinary project.

_The Turing Way_ will enable world class research by facilitating communication interdisciplinary teams.
The chapters will cover the "bridging skills" needed for historians to collaborate with software engineers, clinicians with deep learning algorithm developers, and civil servants to develop ethical and responsible applications of AI technology.

Pathways:
  * **Living with machines** - bidirectional community support to build a useful resource for interdisciplinary teams.
  * **Health programme** - chapters on responsible data sharing, analyses within a safe haven environment, and citizen science.
  * **Policy programme** - chapters on ethical frameworks and bias in machine learning.

_The Turing Way_ will promote best practice in data science at a global scale.
It is a "meta-project" developed and documented openly from the start.
We will nurture a community of contributors who will themselves support a healthy and sustainable open source ecosystem.

Pathways:
  * **Jupyter and Microsoft Azure development communities** -  contribute and promote _The Turing Way_ across their networks of influence, and to listen to "pain points" in their tools experienced by community members.
  * **Carpentries community** - co-design training materials and ensure _The Turing Way_ meets the highest pedagogical standards.

### Research challenges

*Max 300 words*

Translating knowledge from one domain to another is always harder than it first appears.
Tackling the *known unknowns* are the core goal of _The Turing Way_: providing a space for research teams to acquire the skills that they know they lack.
But in helping experts to adopt new tools and practices, we will inevitably identify challenges that the original developers had not forseen.
These *unknown unknowns* - or more specifically, the *unknowns that we thought we knew* - will generate exciting new research opportunities.

Some already identified challenges include:

* Adapting statistical analyses from a domain that collects large amounts of data (financial forecasting) to one with much smaller datasets (mental health).
  Specific case study by Turing researchers Imanol Perez Arribas and Terry Lyons for which data can not be shared for independent verification.
  * How do we, as data scientists looking to translate knowledge across domains, ensure the ethical and statistical rigor of the work when large amounts of data can not be collected or reviewed?
* Tools, practices and systems of data science and AI are moving incredibly quickly.
  Turing doctoral student Alex Campbell spent three months trying to use Tensorflow with neuroimaging data, only to discover that the popular deep learning framework did not provide the functionality in three dimensions that he required.
  In the time it took him to re-write the code in Pytorch, Tensorflow implemented the required feature enhancements. 
  * How do we, as the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI, provide guidance on best practices when the tools we use are constantly shifting beneath us?
  
The _Turing Way_ community will support - as co-authors if appropriate - research projects that seek to push back the boundaries of what can be done in transparent, ethical, reproducible and innovative data science.


### Community benefit

*Max 300 words*

_The Turing Way_ will benefit expert researchers in Data Science and AI.
It will provide them with a platform to share their expertise with a broad audience.
In curating tutorials and best practice guidelines, _The Turing Way_ will help to translate recommendations from the areas in which they were developed, to a much larger body of potential research, industry and government applications.

_The Turing Way_ will reduce the amount of time that life-long learners spend figuring out how they should answer their scientific question.
This online, searchable and interactive handbook will pave the way for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, research engineers and senior academics to adopt practices across traditional domain boundaries.
The Turing research community will be more efficient and effective in conducting transparent, ethical, reproducible, and verifiable research.

The Turing business team will benefit from _The Turing Way_.
The checklists and project design resources will benefit the programme managers and partnerships team.
Resources such as equitable recruitment processes, dynamic presentation guidelines, writing for policy makers, and recommendations for secure password management - internally developed by the business team -  can all be incorporated into _The Turing Way_.
More generally, we will educate the broader community on the best practices for knowledge sharing: making information FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

_The Turing Way_ will benefit the global open source community.
All materials are shared under an open licence and can be re-used, re-mixed and adapted as needed by anyone and for any purpose.
This workpackage will deliver continued support to all community members on navigating GitHub issues, git branches and forks, commits and reviews, and their first pull requests.
We will track the improvements in skills and confident required to contribute to other projects and thus to sustain an open source ecosystem.
