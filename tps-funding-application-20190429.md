### Abstract

*Max 500 words*

Funded as part of the first wave of projects within the Tools, Practices and Systems programme, _The Turing Way_ is currently a handbook for reproducible data science (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
This work package will extend _The Turing Way_ into a series of books: "A How To Guide to Data Science".
Our goal is to capture the vast amounts of knowledge of data science practices from within the Turing community and beyond.
Following an open source, community driven approach, we will welcome contributions from anyone who can support researchers and practitioners in learning or improving the "how" of conducting world-leading research in data science and AI.
This funding request will support a research engineer (1 FTE, 18 months) with expertise in documentation, training, and community building to manage the contributions to the book and four "book dash" events to engage and nurture _The Turing Way_ community.

Reproducibility is important, and multifaceted.
The book currently has chapters on open research, research data management, version control, reproducible computational environments, testing and continuous integration.
But reproducibility does not cover core data science practices such as whether the scientific question is appropriately scoped, if the statistical assumptions are correctly managed, whether a suitable alogorithm or model was applied, how these results may vary according to different fluctuations across systems, in the choice of random seeds, or in how results are visualised to tell a story.
The book does not currently include the aspects of data science and artificial intelligence that define whether work was ethically designed and reported.
By curating this knowledge in an accessible format, _The Turing Way_ series will support the The Turing Institute's goals of delivering world class research, training the leaders of tomorrow, and leading the public conversation.

_The Turing Way_ will not replace academic journals or software packages.
Rather it is a pedagogical opportunity.
A translation of research outputs into curated tutorials, case studies and checklists.
The books are Jupyter Books (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book) which build and host static webcontent directly from markdown files or jupyter notebooks in a GitHub repository.
They are easy to version control, edit and extend.
The notebooks are interactive via a Binder plugin.

The _Turing Way_ community is a global collaboration of research engineers, data librarians, industry professionals, and domain expert researchers at all levels of seniority.
Anyone can contribute to the book at any time and our community manager will provide 1:1 mentorship for anyone who wants to incorporate their knowledge into the books.
We will focus on inclusion and creativity at our four "book dash" events.
These one day sprints allow us to bring together a diverse group to co-create the most useful resource for all.
They will contribute their knowledge to the book, review the content for clarity across multiple domains of expertise, and create personalised pathways through the content to add value to as broad a community as possible.

Metrics of success over 18 months:

* 20 new chapters.
* 100 authors (significant contributions to the books).
* 200 contributors (any contribution to the books).
* 1000 mailing list subscribers (currently 200).
* 50 first pull requests.
* 20 new contributors to other open source projects.


### Route to impact

*Max 300 words*

_The Turing Way_ will help train the data science leaders of the future.
We are committed to giving all early career data scientists the support they need to confidently publish reproducible, accurate, interpretable, responsible and extendable research.
But leaders of the future will not only come from within academia.
Financial analysts, civil servants, people in third sector organisations, and domain experts in almost every sector will need to evaluate applications of data science and AI.
This extension of _The Turing Way_ will be accessible to everyone who wants to learn these skills and the content will adapt to accommodate the needs of these communities.

Pathways:
  * **Training Steering Group** - use of The Turing Way chapters in doctoral training.
  * **Book dash events** - respond to community requests for content and build confidence in early career researchers to share their skills.
  * **Research engineering team** - chapter on effectively scoping an interdisiplinary project.
  * **Turing business team** - chapters on agile ways of working, secure data analysis, version control and open source business models.

_The Turing Way_ will enable world class research by facilitating communication in inter- and multi-disiplinary teams.
The chapters will cover the "bridging skills" that are needed for historians to share their knowledge with software engineers, clinicians with deep learning algorithm developers, and civil servants to develop ethical and responsible applications of machine learning technology.

Pathways:
  * **Living with machines** - bidirectional community support to build a useful resource for interdisiplinary teams.
  * **Health programme** - chapters on ethical data sharing, analyses within a safe haven environment, and citizen science.
  * **Policy programme** - chapters on ethical frameworks and bias in machine learning.
  * **British library** - chapters on data management, archiving, and data standards and ontologies.

_The Turing Way_ will promote best practice in data science at a global scale.
It is a "meta-project" in which we will follow our own advice in working openly by design and documenting our processes to make our work easy to re-use.
We will nurture a community of contributors who will themselves support a healthy and sustainable open source ecosystem.

Specific pathways:
  * **Jupyter and Microsoft Azure development communities** -  contribute and promote _The Turing Way_ across their networks of influence, and to listen to "pain points" in their tools experienced by _The Turing Way's_ community.


### Research challenges

*Max 300 words*

Translating knowledge from one domain to another is always harder than it first appears.
Tackling the *known unknowns* are the core goal of _The Turing Way_: providing a space for research teams to acquire the skills that they know they lack.
But in helping experts to adopt new tools and practices, we will inevitably identify open challenges in that the original developers had not forseen.
These *unknown unknowns* - or more specifically, the *unknowns that we thought we knew* - will generate exciting new research opportunities.

Standards for statistical analyses in one domain, for example financial forecasting, can not apply to small datasets collected for mental health research.
In both case the data can not be ethically shared for verification of the algorithms.
A case study which is already part of _The Turing Way_ (Perez Arribas et al, 2018) provides an excellent opportunity to explore the challenge of translating practices from one application to another.
How do we, as data scientists looking to translate knowledge across domains, ensure the ethical and statistical rigor of the work when large amounts of data can not be collected or reviewed?

A different challenge is that the tools, practices and systems of data science and AI are moving incredibly quickly.
In 2018, a Turing graduate student wasted three months of work trying to run Tensorflow (a deep learning framework) on brain imaging data.
At the time Tensorflow did not support the required functionality in three dimensions, although this was not clearly documented.
In the time that it took the student to rewrite their code using Pytorch the Tensorflow community implemented many of the changes required to analyse 3D volumes.
How do we, as the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI, provide guidance on best practices when the tools we use are constantly shifting beneath us?

The _Turing Way_ community will support - as co-authors if appropriate - research projects that seek to push back the boundaries of what can be done in transparent, ethical, reproducible and innovative data science.
It will develop, capture and promote answers to these currently unanswered and sometime not-yet-identified research questions.


### Community benefit

*Max 300 words*

The Turing Way will benefit current expert researchers in Data Science and AI.
It will provide them with a platform to share their expertise with a broad audience.
It is not possible for any (human) researcher to digest all of the data science literature.
It is challenging to even keep up with current publications in a specific subdomain.
In curating tutorials and best practice guidelines, The Turing Way will help to translate recommendations from the areas in which they were developed, to a much larger body of potential research, industry and government applications.

The Turing Way will reduce the amount of time that life-long learners spend figuring out how they should answer their scientific question.
This online, searchable and interactive handbook will pave the way for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, research engineers and senior academics to adopt practices across traditional domain bounderies.
The Turing research community will be more efficient and effective in conducting transparent, ethical, reproducible, and verifiable research.

Following the Institute's philosophy of "eating its own dogfood", many different groups within the Turing business team will benefit from _The Turing Way_.
The partnerships team will have a resource to facilitate conversations with industry and government data scientists.
The programme managers will have checklists to adapt and follow to ensure that the projects they deliver are of the highest community defined standards.
Human resources, events team, communications and information technology all currently write and provide exceptional guidance to their communities.
Some of these resources, such as equitable recruitment processes, dynamic presentation guidelines, writing for policy makers, and recommendations for secure password management, can all be incorporated into _The Turing Way_.
More generally, _The Turing Way_ will educate the broader community on the best practices for knowledge sharing: making information FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

Finally, The Turing Way will benefit the global open source community.
All materials are shared under an open licence.
This means that they can be re-used, re-mixed and adapted as needed by anyone and for any purpose.
The open license is a necessary - but not sufficient - requirement for broad adoption.
The Turing Way will continue to support all community members in providing the skills required, and the confidence needed, to sustain an open source ecosystem.
All community members will receive 1:1 support (as needed) on navigating GitHub issues, git branches and forks, commits and reviews, and their first pull requests.
We will not re-invent the wheel.
A key metric of success is a contribution from a conversation that starts within the The Turing Way community and ends in an update to documentation, or a new feature being added to an existing project.
