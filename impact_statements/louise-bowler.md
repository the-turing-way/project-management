## Summary

My involvement with the Turing Way centred around adding case studies to the book.
As part of the Turing's Reproducible Research Champions programme, I worked on improving the reproducibility of recent papers written by Turing researchers.
A write-up from each of the projects will appear at the end of a relevant chapter in the Turing Way, with links to the code and guidance on how to set up and use the projects.

In addition, I helped with the organisation of events hosted at the Turing.
These included fortnightly reproducible research lunchtime events, a "meet the Turing Way team" event for students and researchers, the "Boost your research reproducibility with Binder" workshop and the London edition of the Turing Way's book dash.
I also provided reviews for several chapters of the book (Version Control and Reproducible Computational Environments).

## Impact

The case studies will be incorporated into the Turing Way in the coming weeks, pending final reviews from all participants.
The case studies are accessible to non-domain experts, taking the form of write-ups that highlight the challenges of reproducibility in distinct types of project.
Each write-up links to the project's code repository, where thorough guidance on setting up and using the projects is prominently displayed.

On all projects in the Champions programme, I developed good working relationships with the project leads and the PhD students involved.
My knowledge of the projects has enabled me to offer advice on the reproducibility of subsequent work by the same researchers, resulting in stronger publications.
Any teaching and training that I deliver at the Alan Turing Institute over the coming years will be informed by my experiences on this project.

## Personal experiences

Having recently been a PhD student myself, I can relate to many of the challenges experienced in the case studies.
Balancing the pressure to achieve results quickly with the desire to write reliable, reproducible analyses is a difficult task, and I am pleased that I have been able to feed my experiences with the case studies back into the Turing Way.
I hope that the case studies will be useful to students across many different disciplines, and also highlight particular steps that supervisors can recommend to their students.

The Turing Way is the first large-scale open source project that I've been part of, and I found it a very positive experience.
The enthusiasm we were met with each time we presented the project has definitely encouraged me towards adopting more open working practices in the future.
I have also learnt a lot from the rest of the Turing Way team about how to go about building the community around a new project.
