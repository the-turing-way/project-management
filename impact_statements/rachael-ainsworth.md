## Summary

Before joining *The Turing Way* project, I helped facilitate the [Boost Your Research Reproducibility with Binder](/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder) workshop in Manchester and the [Build a BinderHub](/workshops/build-a-binderhub) workshop in Sheffield, and participated in the one-day sprint in Sheffield. 
I then joined *The Turing Way* full time from April through May 2019 with a focus on community building. 
I dove head-first into the project during the hackday at [Collaborations Workshop 2019](/workshops/collabw19/hackdayreport_20190403.md), where I was able to see how contributors navigate the project GitHub repository and where their pain points were. 
I also co-organised, facilitated and reported on the book dashes in [Manchester](/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-mcr-report.md) and [London](/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-ldn-report.md), and gave the Introduction presentation at both events ([Manchester slides](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233610), [London slides](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233654)).

I have refined the [Contributing Guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) through creating contributor [personas and pathways](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/470) and feedback from the hackday, workshops and book dashes to help improve the experience of contributing to the project. 
It is clear that GitHub itself poses the major challenge for many contributors, but it is a very powerful tool for collaborating openly. 
Continuously updating the Contributing Guidelines (and chapters on Version Control and Collaborating on GitHub/GitLab) as challenges are exposed will therefore be essential for encouraging new contributions. 
I have also reviewed pull requests, helped manage the GitHub repository, participated in discussions on Twitter, GitHub and the Gitter channel, and helped people contribute to the project through GitHub. 

I have proposed to present *The Turing Way* at the [Open Science Fair](https://www.opensciencefair.eu/) as a [poster](/conferences/abstracts/OSF19_Poster_submission.md) and/or a [demonstration](/conferences/abstracts/OSF19_Demo_submission.md). 
I am currently preparing the [Boost Your Research Reproducibility with Binder](/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder) for submission to the [Journal of Open Source Education](https://jose.theoj.org/), and will do the same for the [Build a BinderHub](/workshops/build-a-binderhub).
