# HiddenRef submission for The Turing Way

- Category: Practices
- Submitter: Emma Karoune

The Turing Way’s goal is to provide all the information that researchers need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce at the end. It is an open-source project that involves and supports its diverse community to make data science reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive for everyone. 

The project was conceived and is led by Kirstie Whitaker, the lead of the Tools, Practices and Systems Programme at The Alan Turing Institute. The Community Manager, Malvika Sharan, plays an important role in bringing together the community at regular events and nurturing contributions to the ever-expanding resource, an online book. 
The book currently has five guides (Reproducibility, Project Design, Communication, Collaboration and Ethical Research), and a Community handbook. Each guide is a work in progress, as we encourage everyone to keep adding to this resource.
However, The Turing Way is much more than a book: it is a community of practice based around the moonshot goal of making reproducible research ‘too easy not to do’. The outputs belong to The Turing Way community and everyone can freely read, reuse, distribute, modify, and contribute back to the resources in the book. The project is built on open source infrastructure such as Git, Jupiter Book and Netlify.

We foster a culture of collaboration through being explicit that our project is open for contributions in many different ways, and enabling an inclusive workspace by providing a clear code of practice and contributing guidelines. Our community is global and contributors come from a diverse range of scientific disciplines. There are currently over 250 direct Github contributors and more than 5000 unique users monthly. 
The project is also influencing other research communities such as The Health Foundation, UKRI Innovation Scholars, Open Research Handbooks at Reading and York universities, and more.
