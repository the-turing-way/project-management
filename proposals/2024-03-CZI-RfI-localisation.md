Open Science Localisation Hub

- Describe the problem or challenge (200 words maximum)

Advances in science must reflect the breadth of humanity if they are to serve all of humanity equally. While open science can engage a global research community, the dominance of English resources creates barriers for non-English-speaking stakeholders, hindering their participation in scientific progress. With 94% of the global population not speaking English as their first language, and 75% not speaking it at all, the lack of multilingual resources pose challenges in collaboration between international teams. In fields like biomedical research, active inclusion and participation of diverse stakeholders are essential for global knowledge production and sharing outputs to improve health outcomes for all.

Everyone, regardless of language, nationality, or discipline, should have equal opportunities to engage and benefit from scientific advancements. Closing this knowledge gap, therefore, is critical for widening participation and leadership in open science and research. We propose investment in targeted localization and translation, enabling readers to access knowledge in their preferred language and with local contexts.

There is often an unspoken assumption that knowledge flows only from English to other languages. This assumption overlooks the richness and diversity of knowledge, as well as the various knowledge types that coexist beyond the hegemony of the Global North. Open science must facilitate knowledge flow in all directions and in diverse forms. The goal of this project is to establish socio-technical infrastructures that enable open, safe, democratic and horizontal collaboration and discussion, fostering practices and norms of multilingual approaches, thereby promoting a more balanced and diverse scientific landscape.

- Describe how this problem or challenge could be addressed. Include who could be involved, resources needed, and a rough time scale (200 words maximum).

We propose establishing a community-led Open Science Localization Hub to provide resources, expertise, and infrastructure for coordinating, connecting, and supporting open localization efforts. This hub will serve as a global, collaborative platform aimed at recognizing, elevating, and supporting localization work across various open science and research initiatives. Coordinated by The Turing Way, the hub will involve leaders from diverse communities with extensive experience in leading international communities and facilitating community-led localization.

The hub will convene a community of practice, host educational workshops/training, offer fellowships/stipends, do awareness raising and provide customized support to people either leading localization efforts or requiring localization/translation related assistance. Goals will be prioritized from a range of needs identified by the community members that include developing open-source tools and platforms, advocating for policy and funding, researching governance-based localization, establishing bi-directional localization workflows, and integrating community-led localization within Open Science frameworks. Long-term goals include establishing common standards for community-led localization, informed by research analyses and case studies of existing practices.

The hub will be piloted with Latin American researchers. Contributors and stakeholders will include Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (R Community, The Turing Way localization), Batool Almarzouq (The Turing Way, Open Science Community Saudi Arabia), Yanina Bellini Saibene (rOpenSci, R-Ladies), Riva Quiroga (RLadies), Nicolas Palopoli (MetaDocencia), and Reshama Shaikh (Data Umbrella). Additional contributors will be invited. Malvika Sharan and Kirstie Whitaker are the co-leads of The Turing Way, who will provide institutional support.


- Describe the value proposition of your idea/solution to Latin American biomedical researchers and any relevant potential outcomes (200 words maximum)

This proposal will be piloted with the involvement of Latin American open science and research communities in the hub. A Localization Research Network will draw Latin American researchers from disciplines such as biomedical research, where immediate benefits of localization can be demonstrated openly. This network will advise, inform, and establish community-led localization standards, provide training opportunities, and share resources on localization practices, encouraging a bi-directional flow of localization efforts, accessibility, and benefits of scientific resources.

By collaborating with Latin American institutions and communities that have effectively integrated localization into their agenda, we will openly recognize and reward champions and practitioners for their work, such as fellowships, stipends, or other value. The hub will also highlight pathways for academics to stay involved in translating their work, mentor others, and consult with other organizations to continuously refine the localization approach. This effort will be connected with the Wellcome-funded Data Science Without Borders projects that The Turing Way is participating in, to work with biomedical researchers from African institutions. In the future, the hub will also involve communities from other geographical contexts. Our vision is for localization practices to become normalized, sustained by a community of advocates who are recognized and supported by institutes.

- Progress made to date (200 words maximum; optional)

This idea was first shared as a concept note in 2022 by members of OLS, IOI, CS&S, and The Alan Turing Institute (The Turing Way), reflecting on their work across international open science communities. It highlighted possible solutions to address gaps around localization efforts in capacity-building and research, the latter identified in Batool Almarzouq’s research on open source.

This submission further draws from the community-led translation work in The Turing Way that started in 2020 and has been completely volunteer-led (a reflection of a lack of funding dedicated to localization in research). In 2023, a workshop was hosted at the CZI meeting in Argentina to present this work that engaged attendees in exploring the needs, challenges, and roles of a localization infrastructure hub. Follow-up workshops connected attendees with ongoing efforts and co-developed logic models relating to different missions for the hub.

The localization and translation working group in The Turing Way is co-led by Batool, alongside Melissa Black and Andrea Sánchez-Tapia, open science practitioners from Latin America who currently facilitate translations in 8 languages, including Portuguese and Spanish (https://turingway.crowdin.com/turing-way). They host regular meetings convening contributors from across different communities and have presented their work at international conferences like CSV-Conf, Write The Docs, CarpentryCon, FORCE11, FOSS, Einstein Foundation Symposium, among others.


- Anything else you would like to share?

Coordinated by The Turing Way, the Localization Hub will build on and expand the localization work currently undertaken by The Turing Way community and open science practitioners. For more information, see workshop https://bit.ly/4ajv8Ti and Miro: https://bit.ly/3IYIzvS. 
The Turing Way is a community-led open-source project that documents and promotes best practices in data science and research. Over 470 international contributors have written 350+ subchapters and delivered 250+ talks and workshops globally. The book is accessed by over 6,000 users monthly worldwide, including in Latin America. The team has collaborated with members from over 50 international organizations, with institutions including LA-CoNGA physics (multiple Latin American countries), ARPHAI (Argentina), University of São Paulo (Brazil), APHRC (Kenya), and Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) among contributors who have expanded the reach of The Turing Way in Global South communities.
Beyond translation work, The Turing Way Localization Group has put significant effort into two aspects: 1) governance to co-govern the human infrastructure mobilized in the localization efforts; 2) infrastructure integration, the technical publishing tools used in our workflows. Each language team creates localization guidelines to record language-specific recommendations. A proposal was also developed to sustain this: https://bit.ly/3TKoKgO.
