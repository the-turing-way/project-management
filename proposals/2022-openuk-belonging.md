This nomination is for _The Turing Way_ project represented by project leads, a community manager, a core team of 14 staff and volunteer members, and a community of more than 340 contributors from around the world. _The Turing Way_ is an open source and community-led project that aims to open up the potential of data science for everyone. _The Turing Way_ champions diversity by challenging traditionally siloed research cultures from every angle and provides a community-driven handbook for conducting research in a way that welcomes and supports a truly diverse group of researchers.  

Handbook: Our project brings together a diverse community of researchers, educators, learners, administrators, and stakeholders from within The Alan Turing Institute, across the UK, and internationally. We have collectively written a [web-based book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) with five guides on Reproducible Research, Project Design, Communication, Collaboration and Ethical Research, as well as a Community Handbook. We seek to provide all the information that researchers need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are conducting data science and AI research that is ethical, inclusive and easy to reproduce in the end.  

Community and process: _The Turing Way_ is much more than a book: it is a community of practice that promotes a culture of collaboration and belonging among global contributors with a diverse range of domain expertise. As a community-developed resource, the project belongs to the community and is always a work in progress. Shared under an open licence, everyone can freely read, reuse, distribute, modify, and contribute back to the resources. _The Turing Way_ has embedded equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) at the very core of its work and has made significant contributions to the wider STEM field on several levels.

Resources and content: The content of the project focuses on topics that are fundamentally linked to principles of EDI and belonging. As well as being a guide to reproducible research and scientific communication, The Turing way focuses on collaboration and ethical research. The Guide for Collaboration provides recommendations for researchers on how to build diverse teams and create inclusive workspaces spanning topics from remote working to running inclusive events and participatory co-creation. The Guide to Research Ethics grapples with the realities of ethical research, and shares key principles from Responsible Research and Innovation and Research Integrity, as well as sections on activism and internal policy advocacy.  

Collective community efforts: Significantly, _The Turing Way_ team hasn’t produced these guides by choosing a select group of people to decide what is “best practice” but has provided a working example of team science, using a wide community to define the standards and expectations the community would like to see in responsible and ethical research practice. This approach has empowered diverse individuals from different backgrounds, identities and lived experiences to express their viewpoints, fairly represent different realities in research and particularly involve voices from communities that are traditionally marginalised in STEM. _The Turing Way_ now boasts over 345 contributors, who have collectively written over 260 pages across 62 chapters to date. All collaborations and development processes occur in open, challenging the disconnected and isolated nature of the traditional academic research process. Contributors include researchers, open science practitioners, educators, policymakers and data experts across academia, government and industry, in various domains, at all levels of seniority, representing countries including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Uganda, UK, USA, Venezuela and beyond. Based on web traffic monitoring coupled with references in more than 100 online publications, 30+ citations in peer-reviewed articles and personal testimonials, The Turing Way has thousands of users worldwide in academia, industry, open communities and the public sector. The global reach is also reflected in nearly 3000 monthly users of the book worldwide and 20,000+ cumulative downloads of _The Turing Way_ resources from Zenodo. 

Impact: As well as developing its thriving and diverse community, The Turing Way has engaged in collaborations and advocacy work to encourage reproducible research and collaborative and inclusive research cultures. As a result of these engagements, we have influenced multiple research communities and Data Science projects, and have been cited by more than 20 peer-reviewed articles and nearly 100 online publications, including a reproducibility report from the European Union, a policy commissioned by the Mayor of London, Goldacre review for modern open working and several world-leading training and research organisation. We have inspired the many knowledge-sharing projects that replicate The Turing Way’s practices and formats for online repository and community-led initiatives that include a project from the Office of National Statistics, Genomics England, FAIR Cookbook and several projects within the Turing Institute.

Force for culture change in data science: Recent reports have highlighted how much must change in research culture in the UK and open science worldwide for the ambitions we all share in terms of diversity to be realised. _The Turing Way_ is different to other projects focused on diversifying data science in that it has fully embraced the need to change scientific and research culture for the better, to support inclusive research for diverse researchers. _The Turing Way_ provides a blueprint for what needs to change, but also evidence of how to co-create meaningful practices through collaboration. Ultimately the project has enabled thousands of contributors to share their vision of what a truly global research culture would look like and has presented that knowledge in an entirely accessible and open format.
