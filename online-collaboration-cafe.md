# Online Collaboration Cafe

In autumn 2019, _The Turing Way_ community will host fortnightly online "Collaboration Cafes".
If they're successful they will continue into 2020.

The goals of these events are to:

1. Build personal connections between members of the community.
2. Support contributors as they edit, review, design and write content for the book.
3. Celebrate the progress of _The Turing Way_ and collaboratively build consensus on next steps and future directions.

This document outlines how to participate and run a Collaboration Cafe event.

## What is a "Collaboration Cafe"?

### Background

The name "Collaboration Cafe" is inspired by Kirstie's "Shut up and write" group during her thesis writing days in Berkeley, California.
She also learned (her limited) web development skills and how to use git for version control at a Women Who Code meetup in Cambridge which ran in a very similar style.

Kirstie would meet with fellow procrastinators in local coffee shops and they would use the pomodoro technique to keep themselves focused on getting their tasks done.
They were each other's _accountabilibuddies_ üò∏ üë¨ üë≠ ü§ó

The fact that the meetings were at a cafe were really important.
All the members could say hello at the start, and set some personal goals.
Then they would turn off social media, email, internet (whatever worked) and focus on their personal task for a set period of time (20 or 25 minutes).
After that time period was up, they could have a brief chat, grab a slice of cake, another cup of coffee, or treat themselves to some social notifications.
Then, after 5 minutes, they would get back to work on a second focused work session.

The tasks weren't always undertaken in total silence.
Sometimes the breaks were used to ask for help (particularly in the learning to code sessions) and the next focused session could be used for some brief pair programming or detailed explanation.
Other times, the room would be quiet and collaboration would happen in an online chat channel.

At the end of three sessions all the group members would have a slightly longer break, and often go back to their regular work tasks.
It was amazing how much work could be done with some external motivation and the knowledge that a friendly neighbour would know if you got distracted from your personal goals.

The goal of an online Collaboration Cafe is to bring that feeling of friendship, support, and shared motivation to the distributed _Turing Way_ community.

### Bringing the collaboration online in real time

_The Turing Way_ community is distributed around the world, are all from diverse backgrounds, working many different jobs, and contribute for a great variety of reasons.

They are also (for the most part) unpaid to contribute to this open source project.

Our book dash üìöüí®üí® events in May 2019 were wonderfully successful.
Our participants shared ideas, helped each other out, got huge amounts of writing, editing and reviewing done, and had lots of fun.
But in person events are expensive to run, and they only work for people who can take a full day (and the evening before) off from their responsibilities to attend.

The online Collaboration Cafes seek to create the sense of energy and inspiration of in person interactions, without the time and travel commitments.

We'll meet every two weeks in an online [Zoom room](https://www.zoom.us/home) and make use of the [breakout rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Getting-Started-with-Breakout-Rooms) feature to allow small groups to use the 2 hours as best fits them.

If you don't know what to work on, don't worry!
The _Turing Way_ development team will be able to give you lots of suggestions of places you can make a difference.
We'll also always have a virtual room available to support anyone wanting to learn more about collaborating on GitHub and helping you to make your first pull request.

Please get in touch if you'd like to join one and we're happy to add an early (UK) session!

### Timings during the Collaboration Cafe

We'll run the following schedule during each Collaboration Cafe event.

You don't need to know in advance what you're going to do in those pomodoro üçÖ sessions!
There will always be someone who can help you develop a goal, or allocate a task that you can do in a couple of rounds of 20 minutes.

| Time | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Start | üëã Welcome, code of conduct review |
| 5 mins | Introductions and personal goal setting |

| 40 mins | üçÖ 2nd pomodoro session |
| 1hr 0 mins | ‚òïÔ∏è Break  |
| 1hr 5 mins | üçÖ 3rd pomodoro session |

### Connecting and collaborating in real time

We will use Kirstie's Zoom meeting room for the meetings: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/my/kirstiezoom

We will coordinate tasks during the conversation using the _Turing Way_ [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) and a dedicated hackmd notepad (see links in the table above).

The welcome, introductions, breaks and the open discussion will all happen in the main room.
Pomodoro sessions can happen either in the main zoom room in silence, or in breakout rooms for any groups who want to discuss their collaborations or answer questions.

Good first contributions might include:

* Finding a typo in the book and/or repository and fixing it.
* Looking for duplicated information in the book and opening an issue to discuss how it can be combined.
* Finding an old issue or pull request and try to summarize the discussion so it is easy to decide on the next step.
* Adding your personal experience of reproducible research in the always open google form: [https://goo.gl/forms/akFqZEIy2kxAjfZW2](https://goo.gl/forms/akFqZEIy2kxAjfZW2).
